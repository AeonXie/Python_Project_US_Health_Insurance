### Research Question
Health insurance coverage in US counties and its relationship with income

### Data Sources

●	Health insurance coverage data
Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) [State and County 2006-2015]
https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/sahie/datasets/time-series/estimates-acs/

●	Income/other demographic data
2015 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Data Profile (2009-2015)
https://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs/acs5/profile

### What to expect / Methods  

●	Baseline functionality

We propose to examine annual trends in health insurance coverage for all US counties, and demographic and economic differences in coverage status for years 2009-2015, using SAHIE. We will create visual presentations of health insurance coverage by county, and stratify by age group and income level. We will then clean up and merge data from 2009-2015 on health insurance coverage with data on income and other relevant demographics in ACS, on a county level (we wanted to do census tract level but couldn’t find census tract level health insurance data). To investigate the association between coverage status and income, we will examine descriptive statistics and develop a sensible regression model based on relevant demographic variables and income measured as mean/median income, categorized income group, or poverty rate, as well as other alternative specifications. Because Medicaid covers low income and disabled people while Medicare covers people aged 65 and older, we will evaluate which population group is actually the most uninsured, and could benefit from policy changes.

●	Possible extensions

○	Animated map showing changes over the years in uninsured rates by county

○	Graphs showing uninsured rates across age groups and income levels

○	Build a navigable website to present all visualizations and data analyses

○	Others as we get to learn more
